# CS 490 - Exam Management System (Fron-end)

A three tiers system that serves as a course management tool, where students and professors interact in the manner of exam-taking and exam-managment, respectively. The system has an autograding mechanism for the python programming language. 

# Front-End

The front-end (this repo) is written in Javascript and communicates with the middle layer through PHP end-points. It uses Ajax to make async calls to the end-points to avoid page reloads.
